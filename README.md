# BMI Calculator

Problem Statement:- Given the JSON Input.json as an input with weight and height parameters of a person, this code does the following:

    1) Open the JSON programmatically
    2) Check for validity of each person's data i.e. whether there are alphabetical character for 'Gender' field and numeric characters for 'Weight' and 'Height'          fields (This is basically when working with larger input data)
    3) Calculate the BMI (Body Mass Index) using Formula 1 and add this value along with BMI Category and Health risk as a new 3 columns 
    
                                                     Formula 1 - BMI(kg/m 2 ) = mass(kg) / height(m) 2
                                                     
                                                     
                                                    
    4) Save new data as a JSON file Output.json
